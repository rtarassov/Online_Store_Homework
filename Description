Online Store
Three types of products are sold in an online store:
1. Electrical appliances including radio and television
2. Shoes including sports shoes and formal shoes
3. Readings including books and magazines


In this online store, there should be at least the following operations:

Definition of the user that includes the username and password as well as the name,
surname, mobile number, email address and home address information including city,
street name and postal code.
Display the list of all products available in the store to the user along with their
specifications, quantity and unit price
Add product to cart
Remove product from cart
Print the list of all products added to the cart with their number
Print the total prices of cart items


Final Purchase Confirmation: After confirming purchase by the user, the store items
balance will be updated according to the number of items purchased and the shopping cart must
also become empty.

The entry point of the program starts with the user registration and then a menu should be
shown to the user through which he/she can view the list of items and add item to the cart.
The maximum capacity of a cart is 5 items and if filled, it should not be possible to add a new
item and display a message to the user unless the previous item is deleted.
Draw relevant UML diagrams using software such as Visio or Draw.io (or any similar
software).
